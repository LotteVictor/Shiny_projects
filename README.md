# Shiny_projects
Here are the projects I finished in R shiny. So far only the R shiny for my first manuscript can be found here. It runsunder the following io:

Since there is a full ecological simulation running behind it, it can take some while for the output graphs to be computed. In case you are interested in the model, see my other repository NicheEvolution and the publications mentioned in the README file there.
